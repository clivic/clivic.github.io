<p><a href="https://studycrafter.com/">Study Crafter</a> is a visual scripting tool for creating games used by researchers to conduct usability researches. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I created a debugger plugin for it. You can:</p>
- Add debug points to nodes
- Pause the program to see variable states, just like in other Visual Programming IDEs
